## USB to UART Converter
USB to UART (Universal Serial Bus to Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) is an interface converter that allows communication between a USB-equipped computer and devices that use UART serial communication, such as microcontrollers, sensors, or development boards.

### Key Functions:
1. Converts USB signals to serial UART signals (TX/RX).
2. Enables serial communication with embedded systems via a computer.

### Pinout:
1. TXD – Transmit Data (from CH340G to MCU)
2. RXD – Receive Data (from MCU to CH340G)
3. VCC – Power (often 5V)
4. GND – Ground
5. DTR – Optional reset for auto-programming microcontrollers

A simple electronic circuit designed in KiCAD to convert AC signal into DC signal

An AC to DC converter, also known as a rectifier, is an electronic circuit that converts alternating current (AC) — which periodically reverses direction — into direct current (DC), which flows in only one direction. This process is essential in power supplies for electronic devices, as most modern electronics operate on DC.
